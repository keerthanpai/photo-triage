This AWS instance has only 1 GB ram, so running the code here is slower than our system. So we have written down the DeepNet extracted features difference between two images to ~/caffe/examples/train_matrix_2885.npy and ~/caffe/examples/validation_matrix_100.npy file so that training and testing various models be faster.
